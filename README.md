LLM Project: Building a News Research Tool
In the age of digital media, misinformation and biased reporting have become significant challenges. A News Research Tool powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) can help users analyze news articles, verify sources, and extract key insights efficiently.

Key Features:
1. News Summarization – Generates concise summaries of articles while retaining key details.
2. Fact-Checking Assistance – Cross-references claims with verified databases to assess credibility.
3. Sentiment & Bias Analysis – Identifies the tone and potential bias in news articles.
4. Named Entity Recognition (NER) – Extracts key entities such as people, places, and organizations.
5. Trend Analysis – Tracks evolving topics by analyzing multiple sources.
Implementation Steps:
1. Dataset Collection – Gather a diverse dataset of news articles, fact-check reports, and misinformation examples.
2. Preprocessing – Clean, tokenize, and structure the data for model training.
3. Fine-Tuning an LLM – Train the model on news-specific data to improve accuracy in summarization, sentiment analysis, and fact-checking.
4. Building an API/Web App – Deploy the model with an interactive user interface for accessibility.
5. Evaluation & Optimization – Continuously improve performance using user feedback and real-time updates.
By leveraging AI-driven analysis, this tool can empower journalists, researchers, and general users to navigate news intelligently, detect biases, and stay informed with credible information.
